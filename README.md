# Home Server
A collection of my own self-hosted projects at my home server

For a list of what is running on the server, visit: https://strodrig.dev/

## Preface

All of the work done within is based on a setup that I am running using Raspberry Pi (Linux) + K3S . The infrastructure is described as:

> - 2x Pi (1x 4B+ // 1x 3B+)
> - 1x Ubuntu Linux Server
> - DNS management via Google Cloud DNS

## Structure

- This project is structured where each folder (except `./_learning`) is a namespace in the cluster.
